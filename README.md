# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Homepage Clone

ðŸš€ **First Web Project** â€” Built using only **HTML & CSS!**  
I recreated Netflix India's landing page focusing purely on design and responsiveness.

### ðŸŒŸ What I Learned:
- Layering backgrounds with gradients for a cinematic look  
- Responsive design using `@media` queries  
- Styling layouts, buttons, and inputs purely with CSS  
- How much can be achieved without frameworks â€” just patience and practice!
